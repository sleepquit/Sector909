# AUTHOR'S NOTE
This is an editor bundle! I ran into some serious bugs in the build release so instead of fixing them I decided to wrap the game around Godot. If you're a dev, modder, or just plain curious, feel free to launch the editor inside the game directory and goof around. Not everything in there is CC0/free but everything from the "Run" experience (Tutorial, Play) should be CC0.
